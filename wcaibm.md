{: shortdesc}

WCA@IBM is a state-of-the-art code powered by the IBM granite-20b-code-instruct foundation model. The intended user is a professional software developer who does their work in popular IDEs such as Visual Studio Code and Eclipse. The assistant facilitates code understanding, code documentation, unit test writing, and code generation. 

Developers can access the assistant through an IDE extension that is installed directly on their laptop so they can remain in their IDE flow while using these new capabilities. Users must be connected to the internet to use the assistant as the extension calls IBM servers to do the computationally expensive generative AI work.

IBM wants to give its developers the best tools to do their jobs as quickly and efficiently as possible. External tools such as GitHub Copilot show that the act of working with code can be accelerated and improved by using generative AI. But using external tools is risky. IBM is now providing WCA@IBM to accelerate development and innovation, plus to protect our incredibly valuable intellectual property.

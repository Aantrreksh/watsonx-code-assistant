# Foundational models
{: #fmodels}

IBM&reg; watsonx Code Assistant models are trained and maintained by IBM Research.
{: shortdesc}

Presently, the models are used "as-is" from IBM Research. Training and tuning foundational models requires a lot of compute resource and time. As such, updates and retraining will roll out as they're performed. For any updates on the model, check out our [Release notes](../about/release-notes.md) for updates.

In the future, there will be a regular cadence of model refreshes to ensure data quality and accuracy.

# Security and privacy for foundation models
{: #wca-privacy}

{{site.data.keyword.wca_short_cap}} uses IBM Granite foundation models to help you code more quickly and more accurately by using natural language prompts. Your work with these foundation models is secure and private, in the same way that all your work on {{site.data.keyword.wca_short}} is secure and private.

The foundation models that you interact are hosted in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}. Your data is not sent to any third-party or open source platforms.

Any prompts that you create for are accessible only by you. Your prompt text is not accessible or used by IBM or any other person or organization.

Any data that you save is stored in a dedicated {{site.data.keyword.cos_full_notm}} bucket that is associated with your project.

Data that is stored in your project storage bucket is encrypted at rest and in motion. You can delete your stored data at any time.

## Privacy and security of saved work
{: #saved-work}



Only people with Admin or Editor role access to the project or the project storage bucket can view saved assets. You control who can access your project and its associated {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}} bucket.

For more information about asset security, see [Securing your data in {{site.data.keyword.wca_short}}](/docs/watsonx-code-assistant?topic=watsonx-code-assistant-mng-data).

For more information about managing project access, see [Setting up {{site.data.keyword.wcaal_short}} in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/watsonx-code-assistant?topic=watsonx-code-assistant-cloud-setup-a) or [Managing IAM access for {{site.data.keyword.wcaz_short}}](/docs/watsonx-code-assistant?topic=watsonx-code-assistant-wca-iam).
